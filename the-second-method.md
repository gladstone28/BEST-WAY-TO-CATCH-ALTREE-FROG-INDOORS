this is for a large tree frog

Got it — a large tree frog 👍
Those are strong jumpers and excellent climbers, but they’re still easy to handle safely with the right approach.

🐸 Best Way to Catch a Large Tree Frog Indoors
✅ What Works Best (Tree-Frog Specific)
What you’ll need

A deep bucket or tall container (very important)

A towel or small sheet

Cardboard or stiff paper

Optional: gloves

Step-by-Step (Most Reliable Method)

Turn off bright lights
Tree frogs calm down in dim light and jump less.

Throw the towel over the frog
This is the key step.

Gently toss the towel over it.

Frogs freeze when covered.

Cup it through the towel

Use both hands through the towel to gently secure the frog.

Don’t squeeze—just prevent jumping.

Place it into the deep container

Lower towel + frog into the bucket.

Quickly pull the towel out and cover the bucket with cardboard.

Take it outside immediately

Release it near trees, bushes, or a garden.

Best done at night or early morning.

🧠 Extra Tips for Large Tree Frogs

They can jump upward and sideways, so avoid shallow bowls.

If it’s on a curtain or wall, use the towel first—never chase.

Close doors to other rooms before starting.

❌ Avoid These Mistakes

❌ Bare-hand grabbing (they’re slippery and can wriggle free)

❌ Using brooms (can injure legs)

❌ Spraying water mixed with anything (plain water only if needed)
